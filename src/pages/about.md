This is it!

Welcome to my blog!

## Motivation

There was never a proper way to live a UP life -right?

Or so I thought. True, there is absolutely no single way, but there definitely are pathways to make it more manageable.

After x quizzes, y essays, and z months of adjustment, I would like to share to ya'll bits and pieces of my life that I'd wish someone told me.

There shall be more of this as I tread these waters with you guys.

Please feel free to share this to anyone who might need it - because I was that one friend too.
