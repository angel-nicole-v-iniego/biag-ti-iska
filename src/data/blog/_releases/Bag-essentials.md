You don't need emotional baggage in UP. Bring these instead:

# What to Pack in Your UP Bag

## 1. Umbrella

This is an absolute **must-have**. You'll be walking quite a bit from building to building for your classes, and UP weather can be unpredictable. One moment it's sunny, the next it's pouring. An umbrella will save you from getting drenched or scorched!

## 2. Lab Gown and Goggles (for STEM Students)

For all you STEM students out there, keep your **lab gown and goggles handy**. Professors, especially in departments like the Institute of Chemistry, are very strict about this. Your Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is often part of your grade, so don't get caught without it!

## 3. Your UP ID

Your **UP ID** is your key to almost everything on campus. Make sure it's visible at all times, preferably with a lace. Guards at every building entrance will ask for it, so having it easily accessible will save you time and awkward fumbling.

## 4. Charger/Power Bank and Water Bottle

Staying connected and hydrated is crucial. A **charger or power bank** will ensure your devices don't die on you in the middle of a long day. And a **reusable water bottle** is essential for staying hydrated, especially with all the walking you'll be doing. There are water refilling stations in many buildings, so you can easily refill as needed.

## 5. Coins!

Always, always have some **coins** on hand! They're super useful for emergency jeepney rides, especially if it suddenly starts raining and you need to get across campus quickly.

There you have it! These are my top picks for what you should always have in your bag when you're on campus. Being prepared makes a world of difference in your UP life.

Sincerely,
