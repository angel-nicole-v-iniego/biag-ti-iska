# First slap in the face: Math 21.

For those who have done the advanced placement exam, did you feel it hit? I have heard that for many, Math 21 is their first _patikim ng UP_.

Here's how you can do better from now on:

## 1. Lecture Video AND Discussion Video

I know this is a lot to ask, but to maximize your chances of getting real good, this is your best practice.

Watching the lecture videos are helpful as you go to class with an already

In the first place, no one ever told me there were also discussion videos!

Lecture videos are helpful for peeps wanting to dig more in the concepts.

On the other hand, for those wanting to polish their problem-solving skills, I recommend you check out the discussion videos.

Here's the link to the [IMath YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@imathupd/playlists) where you will find both the playlist for lecture and discussion videos.

## 2. Practice, practice, practice

Consider yourself lucky when you've landed on a teacher who gives a lot of samplex.

Otherwise, you can always visit the [MBAN 109](https://www.facebook.com/MBAN109) the organization which periodically post on their page for samplex. They also have face-to-face review sessions where the solutions to the samplex are discussed.

## 3. Search the web for MORE samplex

Here are two sites to begin with when searching for samplex:

First, the [E-RHO: ELECTRONIC RESOURCES HUB ONLINE](https://erho.weebly.com/cabinet-1.html).

This is overall great for looking for a lot of samplex. Although most of them have no answer keys.

With a little bit more digging around the site, [The Stat Drive](https://erho.weebly.com/stat-drive.html) also offers more samplex and even study guides.

Since it's so comprehensive, here's a guide to the conversion of Math Class names\*:

- Math 53 -> Math 21 (Elementary Analysis I)
- Math 54 -> Math 22 (Elementary Analysis II)
- Math 55 -> Math 23 (Elementary Analysis III)
  Overall, really great site!

## 4. Study with friends

Since most of the samplex do not have answer keys, studying with friends is a great opportunity to share solutions and check wach other's answers.

You can host study sessions in-person, over Discord, or nice places to go about studying on campus (which my next post will be about).

Please share to everyone who might need this.

Sincerely,
scical.
