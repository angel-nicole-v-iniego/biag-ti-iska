# No more lobby-ing! - saan pwedeng tumambay?

Say goodbye to "lobby-ing" and hello to productive (or just chill) waiting times in between classes.

## 1. The building cafeteria

This might be the most obvious, but let's not overlook the classic! Most college buildings have their own cafeterias, and they're usually buzzing at peak times (11 AM - 1 PM) but outside that, it's a great option for you to chill.

## 2. Diliman Learning Resource Center

DLRC in Kamia Residence Hall is somewhat a hidden gem. I checked out this place before sharing and it's good if you want to be surrounded with people. There's more people for sure, kind of like a cafeteria. This is a great option when you have classes nearby Palma or even CS.

Check out [DLRC's site](https://ovcsa.upd.edu.ph/student-services/dlrc/) their site for more information.

## 3. Empty classrooms

A lot might be surprised but most of the time, staying in empty classrooms before class starts is actually wise. Think about it ‚Äì you get to enjoy the glorious AC, set up your stuff without rushing, and ensure you're _already_ in your classroom before it even starts. Just remember to be responsible and leave the place tidier than you found it.

## 4. Dorm

If you're a dormer, this is your ultimate hack! Dormitories usually don't have strict "closing hours," making your room the perfect refuge between classes. IMHO, saves time and let's you get a short nap.

Need to catch a quick nap? Want to change into comfier clothes? Your dorm is your best friend. Seriously, it saves so much time and energy.

_Unless, of course, it's pest control day (which is probably why you're looking for alternatives anyway ü§™)._

## 5. Libraries

Aaand we all know libraries are the safest option. Start with the library in your college's or unit's building. Get to know it, see if it fits your vibe, take note of their opening and closing hours and which day of the week are they available. Then, start exploring nearby units as well. Because let me tell you, perhaps **not all libraries are created equal** ‚Äì but that's a topic for my next post! üíÖüèª

Sincerely,
scical.
